# Next-Gen-Intelligent-Traffic-Management-using-YOLO-and-Edge-Aware-Signal-Contro
Implements YOLOv4 on IDD for real-time vehicle detection; computes lane-wise density for dynamic signal switching. Uses MPI for node-level coordination, Python for control logic, and edge-IoT integration for deployment. Visualization built with OpenCV and Matplotlib.
